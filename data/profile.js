      title: "Software Engineer (Full Stack)",
      bio: `I&apos;m Ciaran, a 32-year-old software engineer from Scotland, about an hour away from Edinburgh. I&apos;ve always been what people would call &apos;naturally gifted&apos; with computers, building a computer from scratch when I was 11/12 years old, and from that moment, I was hooked. I love learning how things work but tend to go so in-depth with everything that I do, which can sometimes cause a huge delay in getting things done, but the finished product is usually beyond expectations (9 times out of 10).
  
      Just before COVID hit, I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder, which made sense because I always showed the signs (shy, introverted, terrified of most social interactions, especially around groups of people or in public). More recently, I&apos;ve become aware that I also have ADHD, which also makes sense. These are challenging for me, but like everything we do as developers/engineers/designers, etc., we learn, adapt, and build.
  
      I&apos;ve worked for a few startups over the past decade or so, but throughout my 20s, I suffered many health issues, which ultimately led to me working for myself and diving much deeper into learning. When I say that I go really in-depth with things, I need to know how things work, from the smallest concepts and how they come together to form bigger ideas. How components work together and why they behave a certain way. This is not just limited to web development or software engineering... I apply this to everything in life. I call it &apos;atomic learning,&apos; as I dive so deep into things that you could describe it as going down to the atom to learn how it all fits together.
  
      Today, I&apos;m going to talk about UI/UX Fundamentals and best practices. I was going to talk about Security (Data Encryption and Protocols) but I&apos;ll possibly cover that another time.`,
